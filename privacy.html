    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> September 24, 2025</p>

    <p>
        By using this application, you confirm your agreement with the terms of this Privacy Policy. We may update this policy from time to time.
        All changes will be published on this page.
    </p>

    <h2>What data we may collect and why</h2>
    <p>
        The application does not collect any personal data. We may collect anonymized technical data for the following purposes:
        <ul>
            <li>analyzing app performance and fixing errors (for example, via Firebase Analytics);</li>
            <li>displaying ads (via Google AdMob);</li>
            <li>improving user experience (settings, app interactions).</li>
        </ul>
        Collected data may include: device type, operating system version, system language, advertising identifiers, data about app interactions, and technical logs.
    </p>

    <h2>Advertising and third-party services</h2>
    <p>
        Advertising in the app is provided via Google AdMob. For more information about their privacy policy, please visit:

    </p>
    <p>
        Google Firebase may be used for analytics and improving the app. The Google Privacy Policy also applies to these data.
    </p>

    <h2>Data security</h2>
    <p>
        We take reasonable measures to protect the collected information from unauthorized access, alteration, or deletion. However, no method of data transmission or storage can be absolutely secure.
    </p>

    <h2>Legal requirements</h2>
    <p>
        Data may be disclosed in response to a lawful request from government authorities in accordance with applicable law.
    </p>

    <h2>Age restrictions</h2>
    <p>
        The application is not intended for use by children under 13 years old.
    </p>

    <h2>Access to device storage</h2>
    <p>
        To enable core functions, the application requests permission to access your device storage. This is necessary to find and play music files, as well as to use your own images for theme customization.
    </p>

    <h2>Temporary files</h2>
    <p>
        For some features (audio analysis, pause detection), the application may create temporary files on your device. These files are used locally only and are not shared with third parties. When audio files are removed from the playlist, the corresponding temporary files are also deleted automatically.
    </p>

    <h2>Responsibility for audio file usage</h2>
    <p>
        The user is fully responsible for complying with copyright laws and the legality of using all audio files added to or played in the application. The developer does not check, store, or distribute user audio files and bears no responsibility for their content or legal use.
    </p>
